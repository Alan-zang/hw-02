```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## **DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE CHUNK**
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#run install.packages("cherryblossom") on the console to get the run17 dataset

library(tidyverse)
library(cherryblossom)  
```

## Exercise 1

```{r ex1a, out.width="80%"}
run17 %>%
  filter(event == "10 Mile") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) 
```

The histogram x-axis is age of people run 10 miles and y-axis is count number of the people.THIS REPRESENT the main particepents is young adults (over 20 and less 40 years old)

```{r ex1b, out.width="80%"}
run17 %>%
  filter(event == "5K") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)



```

similarity: they are same tendency: most participants are in a range(age \>=20 and age \<=40), there are seldom participants over 60 or lower than 20. young adults is main force in Cherryblossom difference: number of participants in "5k" is much lessr than "10 miles", maximum in "5k" is around 200 but in "10 miles" is around 1500!
